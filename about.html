				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img class="me" src="images/me.jpeg" alt="Casual picture of Tatiana Menshakova">
				<p>Hi! I’m Tatiana Menshakova, a curious, active, and empathetic person with a passion for learning and meaningful communication. I’m originally from Penza, Russia, and I hold a Master’s Degree in Teaching, Learning and Media Education from Finland, as well as a Bachelor’s Degree in English Teaching from Russia.</p>
				<p>My journey into Information Technology started with my love for education. As a teacher, I was fascinated by how structured content and digital tools could make learning more accessible and engaging. This passion naturally led me to explore web development, where I could combine my skills in content design, education, and technology.</p>
				<p>I enjoy creating websites that are not only visually appealing but also thoughtfully organized — helping people access information efficiently and enjoyably. I’m especially excited about projects that let me apply my background in education while continuously learning and growing in the IT field.</p>
				<p>In my free time, I love to travel, read, and swim. My dream job is one that allows me to work in a hybrid mode, contribute to impactful projects, and keep challenging myself to improve.</p>
				<p>Thanks for visiting my website — I hope it gives you a glimpse into who I am and what I love to do!</p>
